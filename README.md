Hello!

- Call us Romeo or Jesse! You can even switch between the two. 

- Collective pronouns are : HE . HYMN . THEY . CLAW . NARC . IT . ASK

- We are genderfluid (mostly male,though) , Poly , and omnisexual. Sometimes this isnt the case for other alters however.

- We are a fictionkin of over 100 characters, our top fictionkins being Romeo (MCSM) and Jesse (MCSM) . We are very strict about doubles no matter what it is . 
**Do not joke about being literally Romeo or Jesse , be careful using profile pictures / names of either of those characters around us , do not GENUINELY talk about them negatively , and if you kin either of those characters then do not discuss it when I am around. (I know yall probs dont, but thats just so you know! dw.)**
We do not believe doubles of Romeo/Jesse exist, and truly think they are just pretending to be us. So we take our kins very seriously as we identify as those 2 characters on every level including physical . (Plus we consider ourselves a Romeo holothere)

- We are also a therian, conceptkin, gamekin, and plantkin. We actually kin the game MCSM as a whole! Interesting, right?

- We yumeship/selfship and do not mind doubles usually. Its not something we talk about often

- Interests: MCSM, Forsaken, Dandys World, FNAF, alterhumanity, psychology, space, Flamingo, DenisDaily

- **We are diagnosed with Autism, ADHD, and MDD.**

- **We are medically recognized with Narcissistic Personality Disorder ,, Dissociative Identity Disorder (OSDD-1B In specific) ,, and C-PTSD .**

Thank you for reading.
